## Description:
This user interface makes use of CSS grid and two background photos for a mosaic style display. An aerial theme brings the data display to life. This unique style is built such that the selected item will transition in size and opacity.

To see the full effect, be sure to view this project on a large tablet or computer. Phones also work but feature a single width rather than different sized grid elements.

## Key Technologies:

### HTML
